# PR's Knife
I will be adapting a scene from my favorite TV show, The West Wing. This scene is the one where President Bartlett gives Charlie a knife handed down many generations from his family. It's linked here: https://youtu.be/LQlUVfz_qbg?si=szHkTaJIDTdtBSEL You'll play as Charlie, walking through the little lobby area as you banter with the President until you reach the desk. There, you will get the spiel, have to pick up the knife, then exit as another character enters. In a more ordered way, the sequence is outlined below.
1. Hear muffled banter as you start the game, clicking through with some inner dialogue to accentuate how long you've been looking for this knife.
2. Enter the foyer/lobby area, walk over to the president and talk to him before entering the oval office.
3. The oval office needs to be big. Maybe 4 spaces. I want it to be almost comically imposing and grand.
4. The president stands behind a huge desk, the player having to interact with him over the desk.
5. The dialogue goes back and forth here until the presenting of the desk in which you need to pick it up.
6. After that's done, a few more bits of dialogue before you have to exit with this knife in your inventory.
7. The game ends when you exit the door.
